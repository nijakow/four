# Four
This is Four, an engine for MUDs, written in Java!

The project was initiated by [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow) and [mhahnFr](https://github.com/mhahnFr) to serve as the basis for text-based [Multi-User-Dungeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD).

This program is both a socket-server and an interpreter for a language heavily inspired by [LPC](https://mud.fandom.com/wiki/LPC).

Four is being developed in our spare time at the [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/). Its name is derived from the combination of the number `42` with the phrase `for U`, leading to the word `foUr`.
